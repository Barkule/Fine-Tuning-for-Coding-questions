# Fine-Tuning-for-Coding-questions
Time to Fine-tune: Fine-tuning LLAMA 2 in Colab for 1-2 epochs should take around 2-3 hours. Compute Constraints: Colab's free version limits GPU usage. Ensure you save your model checkpoints regularly. Cost: You can stick to free options (Hugging Face, Pinecone, and Colab). Only use the OpenAI API sparingly to stay within the $3 budget.
